# Design And Building A Logging System

If you are a programmer, checking logs when debugging is not strange. We can not identify the file facing an error without logs or understanding how to troubleshoot.

With systems that serve a thousand of users or even a million of users in a day, checking logs is essential because:

- It can help us find the errors affecting the end users.
- Tracking the "health" of the system to "smell" some "abnormal signs" before it can outbreak to affect the system.
